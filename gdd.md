MVP Game Mechanics: Sculpted Silence
1. Core Objective:
Players are presented with a 3D block of voxels. The goal is to break away all the "Ice" voxels to fully reveal the "Glass" sculpture hidden within, aiming for a perfect 3-star score by not breaking any glass.

2. Core Action: Differentiated Tapping
The entire game is controlled by a single tap, but the materials react differently, forming the core puzzle mechanic:

Ice Voxels: Shatter on the second tap. They are the disposable material to be cleared.
Glass Voxels: Shatter on the third tap. Breaking these damages the sculpture and lowers the player's score.
3. Primary Feedback Loop:
Players tap a voxel and must immediately identify its material based on distinct visual cues (crack patterns, color) and audio feedback ("thud" for ice, "tink" for glass). Based on this identification, they decide whether to continue tapping to break it (if it's ice) or to stop (if it's glass).

4. Essential Meta-Game:

3-Star System: Players are scored based on how many glass voxels they break. 0 broken voxels earns a perfect 3 stars.
Sculpture Gallery: Perfectly completed (3-star) sculptures are saved in a gallery for the player to view. Imperfect sculptures are shown with visible cracks, encouraging players to replay levels for a perfect score.
